# Welcome to History in T&T
This repository is a place for students in this course to practice using GitHub as well as start to synthesize what you've done in your core courses.

We'll be using a sample Intro to T&T syllabus and collaborative reading notes to organize those goals.

## Sample Syllabus
You'll practice fetching, making local additions and changes, and pushing using the collaborative sample Intro to T&T Syllabus.

## Reading Notes
This repo also provides a place where you can collaboratively write reading notes about any of the Core Reading List texts.

# This is a Heading
You should change that heading's size.

## This is another heading because I'm cool like that.

### This is a level three heading.  Maybe?
